# Game Strategy
This is a collaborative project that was completed in April 2022.
Edited files: StudentStrategy. The goal was to create a strategy in
a population growth simulator game and to have the highest population at the end of the game.
The StudentStrategy competed against various AI strategies.

The basis of this StudentStrategy is to predict the future state of the board and assign a score to the planets present in the game.
Depending on the state of a planet, such as whether the planet had a surplus population or not, the population is managed accordingly.

The code that I implemented includes: futureStateChecker, isItFirstTurn, & parts of the takeTurn implementation.
My partner and I worked together to brainstorm ideas for the basis of our strategy.
